# MIMOSA2 Reference Data Downloads

MIMOSA2 can use various types of reference data to construct metabolic models from a set of microbiome data. A subset of these are available for download below. 
The methods used to generate these files are described in the MIMOSA2 manuscript. Scripts to re-generate these files can be found [here](http://github.com/borenstein-lab/MIMOSA2app/scripts/).

### Taxon-specific metabolic models, processed and formatted for MIMOSA2 compatibility: 

- KEGG reaction models for each Greengenes OTU (based on KEGG Ortholog inferences from PICRUSt1)

- KEGG reaction models for each SILVA OTU (based on KEGG Ortholog inferences from PICRUSt2)

- AGORA models (reconstructions from Magnusdottir et al Nature Biotech 2016)

- CarveMe/EMBL_GEMS models (reconstructions from Machado et al Nucleic Acids Research 2018)

### Processed mappings for linking OTUs to genomes and models:

- Mapping from Greengenes OTUs to AGORA-linked genomes

- Mapping from Greengenes OTUs to RefSeq genomes

- Mapping from SILVA OTUs to AGORA-linked genomes

- Mapping from SILVA OTUs to RefSeq genomes
