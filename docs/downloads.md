# MIMOSA2 Reference Data Downloads

MIMOSA2 can use various types of reference data to construct metabolic models from a set of microbiome data. These are provided or linked below. 
Details on how these files were generated can be found in the MIMOSA2 manuscript. All of the pre-processing scripts used to generate these datasets can be found [here](http://github.com/borenstein-lab/MIMOSA2app/scripts/).

Taxon-specific metabolic models, processed and formatted for MIMOSA2 compatibility: 

- KEGG reaction models for each Greengenes OTU (inferred by PICRUSt1)

- KEGG reaction models for each SILVA OTU (inferred by PICRUSt2)

- AGORA models (Magnusdottir et al Nature Biotech 2017)

- CarveMe/EMBL_GEMS models (Machado et al Nucleic Acids Research 2018)

Processed mapping for linking OTUs to genomes and models:

- Mapping between Greengenes OTUs, SILVA OTUs, AGORA-linked genomes, and RefSeq genomes
