# Frequently Asked Questions about MIMOSA2
Make this have its own sidebar menu

- What kind of microbiome data can I use? Can I provide transcriptomic data?

- How is MIMOSA2 different from MIMOSA1?

- Why does MIMOSA2 only analyze some of my metabolites?

- Which reference database should I use?

- I don't have a KEGG license. Can I still use the KEGG models?

- Can I calculate metabolic potential scores even if I don't have metabolomics data?

- What about metabolomics features that have not been assigned a compound identification?

- What does it mean when a metabolite is negatively predicted by metabolic potential (negative slope)?

- Why do I get different results with different reference databases?
